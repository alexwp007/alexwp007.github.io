## Alexwp007's Informative Page

Welcome to my temporary page where I post things. As I initiate my projects, they will be posted here and updated frequently for you to see and follow along if that is what you want to do.


Initially when I started this module assignment, I ended up having my account flagged and my progress locked for anybody to see. Support took ages, so I had to redo this assignment using another email. 


### Things that frustrate me
```markdown
**1.** Roommates girlfriend
**2.** Assignments with random due dates
**3.** Those weeks where all those test align back to back (such as this week)
**4.** As far as I am in my career, I still have to do simple calculations such as:
        - 0.05*1.5 (most recent calculation according to my calculator)
        - 27/9
        - 159*3*exp(8)*0
        

```
