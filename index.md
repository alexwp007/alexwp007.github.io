## Alexwp007's Informative Page

Welcome to my page where I post things. As I initiate my projects, they will be posted here and updated frequently for you to see and follow along if that is what you want to do.



### Markdown

Initially when I started this module assignment, I ended up having my account flagged and my progress locked for anybody to see. Support took ages, so I had to redo this assignment using another email. 

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alexwp007/alexwp007.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
